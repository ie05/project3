## Twitter Bot Enriched Features: Jack Robo Burton

### Features added: CRUD functions accessing Twitter's API, authentication


### What Bot Does
Jack Burton is possibly the greatest hero to ever walk the Earth at least in his own mind. He plays the main role in Big Trouble in Little China, an action/comedy released in 1986. It's a classic. Jack is an anti-hero, and mostly provides comic relief.

As such, Jack in bot form takes headlines from The Onion on twitter and reposts them as advice, from the greatest action hero ever.

To use this app you'll need:
* A twitter account https://twitter.com/signup
* A new twitter app https://apps.twitter.com/
